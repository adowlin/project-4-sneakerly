Sneakerly is a sneaker rental websitw that allows users to rent premium sneakers from a reputable source. This website was created for submission as my Milestone Project 4 as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute.<br>
 
## User Experience (UX)

The sneaker industry is undergoing a period of huge growth, with popular sneakers selling out instantly from retailers, and being re-sold at after-market values much higher than the original retail value.<br>
This site advances the user's goals by allowing users to rent premium sneakers at affordable prices, allowing them to have the full experience of wearing sought-after styles, without needing to pay huge reseller prices, and without needing to compete against automated purchase bots on retailer websites.<br>
It advances the site owner's goals by providing them with a means to make money from rentals, and they will also be allowed to charge customers late/missing/damaged fees.<br>

The User Experience for this site was planned & developed using the [5 Planes of UX Design](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05): Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, Surface.
